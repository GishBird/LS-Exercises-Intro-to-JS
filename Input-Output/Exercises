1. Write a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, {name}! where {name} is the name you entered:
//
let rlSync = require("readline-sync");
let name = rlSync.question("What's your name?\n");

console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

2. Modify the greeter.js program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.
//
let rlSync = require("readline-sync");
let firstName = rlSync.question("What's your first name?\n");
let lastName = rlSync.question("What's your last name?\n");

console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}`);

3. Modify the age.js program you wrote in the exercises for the Variables chapter. 
The updated code should ask the user to enter their age instead of hard-coding the age in the program. Here's an example run:
//
let rlSync = require("readline-sync");
let age = Number(rlSync.question("How old are you?\n"));

console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10}  years old.`);
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 20}  years old.`);
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 30}  years old.`);
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 40}  years old.`);
